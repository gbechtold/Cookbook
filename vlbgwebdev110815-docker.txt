Who to orchestrate Docker

Problems
 - parameterization (dev, staging, production)
 - deployment: (upgrade/Rollback)
 	- Continous integration: Buildmachine makes build, tags, deploys and makes rollback if necessary
 - Container Distribution
 	- System Managemd
 - Service Discovery
 	- Security: Amazon encryption. Every Client can only login with its creditions
 - Security

Approaches
 - ectd: auto healing cluster
 - storage, logik, routing nodes
 - cloudformation template

 	- bitbucket -> ci -> bamboo -> apt-images 
 		- buildtask -> pulls apt-images -> dockerimages
